/**
 * 
 * 
 * You have a block with the dimensions 4 × n. Find the number of different ways
 * you can fill this block with smaller blocks that have the dimensions 1 × 2.
 * You are allowed to rotate the smaller blocks.
 * 
 * Example
 * 
 * For n = 1, the output should be fillingBlocks(n) = 1.
 * 
 * There is only one possible way to arrange the smaller 1 × 2 blocks inside the
 * 4 × 1 block.
 * 
 * For n = 4, the output should be fillingBlocks(n) = 36.
 * 
 * Input/Output
 * 
 * [time limit] 3000ms (java)
 * 
 * [input] integer n
 * 
 * Guaranteed constraints: 0 <= n <= 21.
 * 
 * [output] integer
 * 
 * An integer representing the number of possible configurations of smaller
 * blocks within the larger block.
